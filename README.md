# Blogs Site

Built by : **Aung Pyae Phyo (Victor)**

Learnt from : **Coding with Dawid Youtube channel** 

This is a full-stack web application built with ***Node.js*** for backend and ***React.js*** for frontend. 


## Description
This is a blogs site where people can read blogs, upload images, write blogs, update/delete their own blogs and manage their blogs. Public users are able to see and read the overall blogs from other users but will not be able to post blogs of their own. To create blogs and manage your content, you will first have to register for an account and log in. Once you logged in, you can start creating your own blog and can update or delete your old blogs. ***Happy writing blogs!***

> NOTE : The blogs page will only show the latest 20 blogs created by users.

## Pre-requisites
- Node.js *(v22+)*

## How to initiate the website
Copy this git repo into your preferred code editor.

Once inside the codebase, split 2 terminals for the root directory. The first one will be used for running the frontend while the second one will be used for running the backend server.

In the first terminal, go to the frontend folder using `cd client`. Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies. Then you can start the project with the command `npm run dev`. Leave this terminal open.

Now in the second terminal, go to the backend folder using `cd server`. Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies. Then start the project by running the command `npm run start`.

> Take note that both terminals must be running the frontend and backend servers.

Now, you can start using your blogs page.
